There once was a flapjack, that most likely did it. Did what, you may ask?
Mrs. Butterswoth and Aunt Jemima were in a heated dispute about which of
their syrups are the best, and the rest of the cabinet was growing weary 
of their loud arguing. One day, Mrs. Butterworth was gone, and Aunt Jemima nor
the rest of the town knew where she was. Who kidnapped Mrs. Buttersworth? 
It was most likely the pancake. 
Mrs. Butterworth loved to have pancackes. She would sit with her syrup and pancakes and eat them to glory for breakfast everyday. She would forget the entire world and enter another realm during that time. Mr. Butterworth hated this. "I would appreciate some attention for once." Maybe she was absorbed in doing th same thing sh loved doing.
